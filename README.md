# VOX Voice Classification Research Platform

A modern web application built to support machine learning research in voice gender classification, enabling researchers and participants to contribute voice data for advancing AI-powered audio analysis.

## üéØ Project Overview

This platform was developed as part of a comprehensive voice classification research project that compared the performance of five distinct machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, and 1D CNN) in classifying voice recordings by gender. The web application serves as both a data collection tool and a research interface, supporting the academic findings that demonstrated CNNs achieving 92% accuracy while uniquely improving with increased data volume.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vox-voice-research.git
   cd vox-voice-research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env

   ```

4. **Set up Supabase database**
   
   Create the following table in your Supabase project:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE voice_recordings (
     id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     gender TEXT NOT NULL,
     age_range TEXT NOT NULL,
     file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
     phrase_text TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   
   -- Create storage bucket
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
   VALUES ('recordings', 'recordings', true);
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser
